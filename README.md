# iTwin Platform CLI

The **iTwin Platform CLI** is a command-line tool for interacting with the [iTwin Platform](https://developer.bentley.com). It enables automation of common workflows such as managing iTwins and iModels, synchronizing design data, handling storage, and controlling user access.

🚀 **Why use the iTwin CLI?**
- Automate iTwin and iModel creation, updates, and management.
- Streamline design data synchronization and versioning.
- Manage users, roles, and permissions efficiently.
- Automate workflows with scripts, scheduled tasks, and data pipelines.

> **⚠️ Note:**  
> The iTwin CLI is in active development and is **not intended for production workflows**. It is pre-release and may contain breaking changes in the future. (Vilius's suggestion - Maybe this comes at the beginning of this section, before the intro.)
