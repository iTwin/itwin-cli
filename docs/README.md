## Installation

Getting started with the iTwin CLI is quick and easy. Here's how to install it on your system:

1. **Download the Installer**  
   Head over to the [iTwin CLI Releases](https://github.com/iTwin/itwin-cli/releases/latest) page and grab the latest version for your operating system.

2. **Run the Installer**  
   The installation process varies depending on your system:
   - **Windows**: Double-click the `.exe` file and follow the installation wizard.
   - **macOS**: Open the `.pkg` file and complete the installation steps. 
   - **Linux**: Extract the `.tar.gz` file and run:

## Authentication

Before you can use the iTwin CLI, you'll need to log in. This authenticates your session and allows you to securely interact with the iTwin Platform.

To log in, simply run:
```bash
itp auth login
```

This will open your default browser for authentication. Once you're logged in, your session will remain active, so you won't need to log in again for a while.

To verify your login status, run:
```bash
itp user me
```

This will show your account details, confirming you're properly authenticated.

> ðŸ’¡ For more specialized authentication workflows, see [itp auth login](auth/login.md).
